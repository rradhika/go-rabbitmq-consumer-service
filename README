# GoFiber + RabbitMQ Starter Project

A modular boilerplate built with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io) and integrated with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) using the official `amqp091-go` client. This project supports live reload using `air`, and is developed with:

- Go **1.24.3**
- **Windows/amd64** environment
- RabbitMQ broker for message queuing
- Modular architecture (handlers, routes, config, utils)

---

## Getting Started

## Queue Consumption (Goroutine)

This project includes a **RabbitMQ consumer** that automatically runs in the background using a Go **goroutine**.

When the app starts, it:
- Connects to `hello_queue`
- Launches a goroutine that listens for messages
- Logs each message to the console in real time

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

```go
go func() {
    for msg := range msgs {
        log.Printf("ðŸ”¥ Received message: %s", string(msg.Body))
    }
}()

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.24.3 (Windows/amd64)](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [RabbitMQ installed locally](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
- [Air (hot reload tool)](https://github.com/air-verse/air)

### Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rradhika/go-rabbitmq
cd go-rabbitmq
go mod tidy
